### helllooo there, dear reader!

You may call me Lillie, or Yogurt! I'm a synthwave enthusiast and webcore addict who makes *slightly terrifying* Minecraft maps.
And when I'm not doing *that*, I'm studying cybersecurity and viruses, making blursed block funnies, and drawing. ~~Or I'm procrastinating, watching @Endermanch and Phoenix SC on YouTube.~~

message me anytime <3
nice to meet you!!
